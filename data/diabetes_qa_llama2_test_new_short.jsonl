There is no role of antibiotic in this. Instead, you should take intestinal digestive enzyme supplementation.2) Elevated SGPT level indicate either liver function is weak or liver has too much load to work. Fatty liver is condition in which excessive fat get deposited in liver tissue and affect liver function. This is the reason for elevated SGPT level in your case.3) Fatty liver is due to high level of fat in blood stream secondary to lipid (fat)-rich diet. This might lead to elevated cholesterol level. Thus, it is recommended for you to undergo lipid profile test.4) Mild fatty liver is reversible condition. You should do - regular exercise, intermittent fasting (weekly once), high protein diet, low fat-diet, use of omega-3 fatty acid containing oil in food preparation, avoidance of alcohol intake. Your SGPT level can come to normal range with these measure in 15-20 days. Hope I answered your query. If you have any further question, I would be happy to help you. Have a nice day!"}

I have felt like Ive had a sinus cold for the past few weeks and then discovered a sore on the inside of my left nostil.. could they be connected", "output": "Hello Wanda and welcome. Thanks for sharing your concern. The roots of upper molars are in very proximity with the maxillary sinus above.Therefore, sometimes it becomes difficult to diagnose whether the patient presents pain due to tooth infection or sinusitis. But clinical evaluation with supporting x-rays makes it clear whether the origin of infection is teeth or sinus.Therefore, in my view please meet your dentist/ENT specialist for a sinus view x-ray. This will make things pretty clear.Meanwhile, do take good care of yourself.ET us know for further doubts. Thanks. Take care."}

My doctor changed my meds to three pills 5 months ago, Metformin gave extreme gastro side effects. So I have been taking Januvia, Glimeperide and Glipezide. It kept my blood sugar much lower but not perfect. I had 3 episodes of symptoms of low blood sugar but I never got a reading lower than 80. Now my pharmacists has questioned the 3 medication so, as of 3 weeks ago I no longer take Glimeperide.

Usually diabetic medicines with metformin may cause abdominal problems like gastritis, ulcer.make sure that your sugar level is under control especially HE a1c is under control. Pain in lower abdomen and sternum is exactly due to gastritis so it's better to take anti ulcer medicines to solve this problem avoid taking oily and spicy foods avoid taking tea coffee or milk avoid some vegetables like radish cabbage and cauliflower so that it may help to reduce gastritis. Consult a physician for medications, thank you."}

Be in contact with your husband every 2 to 3 days after your periods stop.  Take progesterone for next 2 weeks. Do a urine pregnancy test at home after that.  Discuss with your doctor regarding this.  The problem in PCs is with ovulation. So, you have to take medicines for ovulation.  Bigoted alone will not help.  Hope I have answered your question.
